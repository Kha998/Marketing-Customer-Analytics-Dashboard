# Marketing-Customer-Analytics-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project addresses this challenge by developing an interactive Marketing & Customer Analytics Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard integrates campaign performance data with customer demographic and behavioral information to deliver insight-driven analytics that support strategic marketing and business decisions.

## Project Information

### Background
In competitive retail environments, marketing teams must continuously evaluate campaign effectiveness, understand customer behavior, and identify the key factors driving purchasing decisions. However, raw marketing data alone does not provide actionable value unless it is structured, analyzed, and presented in a clear and meaningful way.



### Problem Statement
Despite executing multiple marketing campaigns across different products and channels, the business lacks a consolidated analytical view to answer critical questions such as:
- Which marketing campaigns generate the highest revenue and purchase volume?
- Which product categories contribute most significantly to total sales?
- Who are the most valuable customer segments?
- What factors most strongly influence campaign acceptance and spending behavior?

Without a unified analytical solution, marketing decisions risk being based on assumptions rather than data.

### Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:
- Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns based on purchases and revenue
- Identify top-performing products and sales channels
- Analyze customer demographics and purchasing patterns
- Determine key drivers influencing campaign acceptance and sales value
- Present insights in an executive-friendly format for data-driven decision-making

### Data Overview
The dataset used in this project includes:
- Marketing campaign performance data
- Product-level sales information across multiple categories
- Customer demographic attributes such as age, income, education, marital status, and household composition
- Purchase channel data including in-store, web, catalog, and deal-based transactions

The data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to support efficient analysis within Power BI.

### Scope of Analysis
The analysis focuses on descriptive and diagnostic analytics, including campaign performance comparison, customer composition analysis, product contribution assessment, channel effectiveness, and identification of key purchase drivers. Predictive modeling is outside the scope of this project.
